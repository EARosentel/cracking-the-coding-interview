# cracking-the-coding-interview
This project is a place to practice coding problems found in the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" by McDowell.

Solutions seen here might not have been arrived at on the first try, but I wanted to practice trying to solve them and optimizing later.

Additionally this is intended to show appropriate unit testing.
